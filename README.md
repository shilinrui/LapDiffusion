# LapDiffusion: High-Frequency Diffusion Models for Guided Thermal Image Super-Resolution

We propose a high-frequency visible image guided thermal image super-resolution diffusion model, which effectively solves the problem of high-frequency information loss in thermal images during super-resolution processes. The code will be available soon.
